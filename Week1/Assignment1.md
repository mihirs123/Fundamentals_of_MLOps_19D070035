# Q1
AIOps helps in increasing efficiency of IT operations and is achieved by automating incident/management  diagnostics and intelligently finding the root cause through machine learning. By sifting through the noise generated by monitoring systems and reducing the false positives, these solutions present technical teams with high quality information that is easy to understand, so that they can get to work on a resolution

MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on creating an automated pipeline for bringing machine learning models into production. It looks to overcome the disconnect between data science or data ops teams and infrastructure teams, to get models into production faster

In contrast to AIOps, MLOps doesn’t directly refer to a machine learning capability per se, with algorithms processing data. Rather, it’s a way to manage and streamline the building, deployment and maintenance of those algorithms.
